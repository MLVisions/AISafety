<p>Preparation is the best defence against rapid change. Use these strategies to protect your wellbeing, financial security and community. Click on each card to reveal additional guidance and links.</p>
<h3 id="spot-manipulation">🔍 Spot manipulation</h3>
<p><strong>Learn to recognise AI‑generated media</strong></p>
<p>Identify AI‑generated images and audio by looking for unnatural eye movements, mismatched lighting and inconsistent details. Verify the source before sharing or acting on the information. Deepfake and voice‑cloning scams are becoming increasingly common.</p>
<h3 id="verify-protect">🛡️ Verify &amp; protect</h3>
<p><strong>Establish safe phrases and verify requests</strong></p>
<p>Set up safe phrases with loved ones and always call back before sending money. Treat unsolicited messages with scepticism, and do important transactions in person when possible. Basic precautions can thwart impersonation and fraud.</p>
<h3 id="reskill-adapt">💡 Reskill &amp; adapt</h3>
<p><strong>Build AI‑adjacent skills</strong></p>
<p>Develop skills that complement automation: data literacy, prompt engineering, and human‑centred design. Cultivate portfolio careers and collaborate with machines instead of competing against them. According to labour forecasts, as many as 83 million jobs could be displaced by 2027; reskilling helps you stay relevant.</p>
<h3 id="build-community">🤝 Build community</h3>
<p><strong>Form local AI‑check groups</strong></p>
<p>Join or organise local groups to share knowledge, support mental health and coordinate responses to emerging threats. A strong network fosters resilience and counters isolation during social and economic shocks.</p>
<h3 id="diversify-investments">💰 Diversify investments</h3>
<p><strong>Spread capital across asset classes</strong></p>
<p>Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread savings across equities, high‑yield cash, real estate, AI/tech and a small exposure to crypto to reduce volatility and preserve purchasing power. Consider how policy and inflation affect different assets.</p>
