    <h2 id="mental-health-labour-disruption">Mental Health &amp; Labour Disruption</h2>
<p>Generative AI could expose <strong>300 million</strong> jobs worldwide and potentially displace around 85 million roles within a few years. Entry‑level roles in programming, sales and accounting are already disappearing rapidly. As self‑driving and retail automation spread, up to 40% of jobs could be replaced. Such displacement can trigger anxiety, depression and a crisis of identity for many workers.</p>
<p>The mental load extends beyond job loss. Long‑term unemployment is strongly associated with depression, suicide and widening inequalities. Cognitive dissonance and fear of synthetic intelligence can erode trust, making people more susceptible to crime and misinformation.</p>
<h2 id="economic-uncertainty-resilience">Economic Uncertainty &amp; Resilience</h2>
<p>Economic shocks and rapid technological change create uncertainty. To build resilience, societies must invest in re‑training and social safety nets. While AI may create new roles, the skills gap and relocation challenges can leave many behind. Equitable policies and support networks are essential to prevent social fragmentation.</p>
<p>Mental health services and community programmes can mitigate stress and help individuals navigate career transitions. Encouraging open dialogue about AI's impact reduces stigma and empowers people to take proactive steps.</p>
<h2 id="community-support">Community &amp; Support</h2>
<p>Communities are a critical bulwark against the social disruptions of AI. Form local "AI‑check" groups to share information, support mental health and coordinate responses to emerging threats. Building social capital fosters resilience and helps individuals feel less isolated.</p>
<p>Professional counselling, peer‑support networks and accessible mental‑health resources should be part of any long‑term strategy. Together we can face uncertainty and shape a future that balances innovation with human wellbeing.</p>
