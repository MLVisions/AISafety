      <h2>AI Capabilities Today</h2>
      <p>Large language models (LLMs) have already reached professional benchmarks.  GPT‑4 scored around 75 % on the U.S. bar exam and placed in the 90th percentile【877154183811370†L26-L30】, while ChatGPT performed at or near the passing threshold on all three stages of the USMLE medical boards【877154183811370†L26-L33】.  Beyond chatbots, foundation models trained on millions of images can diagnose eye disease and even predict systemic conditions like heart failure【877154183811370†L32-L36】.  LLMs can draft software, contracts and presentations from natural‑language instructions, effectively acting as coding copilots【877154183811370†L37-L39】.</p>
      <p>However, AI also introduces new risks.  Voice‑cloning systems can replicate a person’s speech from just a few seconds of audio, enabling plausible scams【877154183811370†L43-L47】.  Malicious actors can spin up realistic chatbots to harvest payment details, and generative AI can doctor politicians’ speeches or create deepfakes to undermine elections【877154183811370†L142-L155】.</p>

      <h2>Investment &amp; Economic Impact</h2>
      <p>Private AI investment in the United States reached <strong>$109.1 billion</strong> in 2024, nearly twelve times China’s investment and twenty‑four times the U.K.’s【240192331752712†L483-L489】.  Hyperscale cloud providers doubled their projected AI capital expenditures between March 2024 and May 2025 (from $207 billion to $405 billion for 2026)【240192331752712†L497-L503】.  OpenAI’s weekly average users skyrocketed from 180 million to over 800 million【240192331752712†L497-L503】.</p>
      <p>Projections suggest AI could add <strong>$15.7 trillion</strong> to global GDP by 2030【240192331752712†L508-L524】.  In advanced economies, AI may automate around 25 % of labour tasks【240192331752712†L530-L569】 and displace up to 83 million jobs by 2027 while creating 69 million new roles【240192331752712†L562-L569】.  Productivity gains, combined with increased consumption, drive these forecasts【240192331752712†L520-L524】.</p>
      <p>At the same time, high AI capital ratios can reduce labour demand, increasing unemployment and underemployment【877154183811370†L142-L139】.  This section invites you to explore the tension between productivity gains and societal impacts.</p>

      <h2>Agentic AI &amp; Swarm Architecture</h2>
      <p>LLMs do not “reason” like humans; they infer the most likely next word based on statistical patterns【877154183811370†L80-L86】.  Nevertheless, emergent behaviours arise as models scale, and different agents built on the same base model can behave very differently depending on their training and memory retrieval strategies【877154183811370†L92-L106】.</p>
      <p>A <strong>single‑agent architecture</strong> integrates memory, retrieval and tools into one workflow【877154183811370†L49-L60】, whereas a <strong>multi‑agent architecture</strong> employs an orchestrator to coordinate specialised agents performing concurrent tasks【877154183811370†L49-L60】.  Key features of multi‑agent systems include autonomy, collaboration, competition and adaptability【877154183811370†L61-L64】.  Our website’s update pipeline uses a swarm of agents to summarise new information, verify context, compare with existing content, develop updates, validate them and deploy changes.</p>

      <h2>Future Trends &amp; Opportunities</h2>
      <p>Looking ahead, the humanoid robot market could exceed $5 trillion by 2050【994097148421954†L72-L79】, and innovations like robotaxis and Optimus robots might create a $24 trillion opportunity【994097148421954†L72-L79】.  Investments in semiconductors, cloud and robotics may surge as governments enact AI‑centric action plans【994097148421954†L31-L48】.</p>
      <p>However, unsustainable euphoria can precede sharp corrections.  The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs in mid‑2025 amid AI enthusiasm, but analysts warn that parabolic moves seldom last【877154183811370†L125-L129】.  Balancing innovation with caution - and embedding strong privacy and security measures - will be essential.</p>
